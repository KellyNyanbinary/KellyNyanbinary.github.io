        Pallets of Adobe Creative Suite 6 physical media disc
        packages sat in rows like a warehouse museum exhibit. Mei Zhang walked past them on her way in and paused. It
        reminded her of buying her first copy of Photoshop 7 with money she earned doing small commissions in high
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        She swiped her card and entered the engineering building. Her monitor was covered in sticky notes: compiler
        flags, bug-tracking IDs, ideas she never had time to finish. When she logged in, a new internal memo sat at
        the top of her inbox.

            Beginning Q2, we'll start adapting the CS codebase for
            subscription-based activation. Product verification will occur through
            Adobe ID login, with periodic checks every 30-90 days. We're sunsetting
            the boxed distribution model.

      <h2>Mei Zhang's Reaction</h2>
      <p>
        Mei stared for a long time. She reread the lines until they blurred. She had worked on rendering optimizations
        and improvements to the color pipeline. She liked math. She liked art. She did not like locks. They reminded her
        of limits, of functions hidden behind paywalls, of access granted only to the verified and billable. A lock was
        something she coded once for trial versions in college, a patchwork of expiration dates and hashing functions.
        It felt like writing code not to build, but to deny.
