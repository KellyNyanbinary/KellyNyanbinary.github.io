# This real tweet can be embedded as a fictionalized social media post, capturing the grassroots backlash at the moment of transition. In the story, a character doomscrolling in 2013 might see @dzenzel’s plea and a flurry of retweets, symbolizing community anger. Including this microblog citation (with its Change.org link) as a screenshot or quote in the text grounds the narrative in authentic social media reaction, lending realism to the depiction of outraged users rallying against Adobe’s new subscription model.
