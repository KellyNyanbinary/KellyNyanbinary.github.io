      That night, she sat at her apartment desk. The glow of her secondhand monitor reflected off her glasses. She
      zipped a folder: `adobe_cloud_prototype.zip`. Inside were interface diagrams, mockups of the activation flow, and

        Redditors cite the leak to argue that Adobe planned to “shut down the
        app offline” after validation failures, echoing fears recorded in the
