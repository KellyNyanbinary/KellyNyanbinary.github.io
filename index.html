      <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
      <h3 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
        This may not surprise you as I am studying computer science, but I am indeed interested in computer science. I
        intend to focus on the machine learning field in the future, but I am also interested in game development and
        web development. My least favorite programming language is C++, and I intend to learn Rust.
      </p>

      <h3 id="computer-hardware">Computer Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning about computer hardware. This includes understanding the performance and value of consumer
        computer parts ranging from CPUs and RAM to fans and PSUs. Beyond just those parts, I investigate laptops,
        mobile phones, virtual reality headsets, and sometimes other computer gadgets. I also enjoy learning the inner
        workings of silicon chips, from transistors to logic blocks to core designs. Furthermore, I like learning about
        lithography and other steps involved in creating computer chips.
      </p>

      <h3 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h3>
      <p>
        It can be argued that keyboards are just a subset of computer hardware, but the hobby of custom
        mechanical keyboards is large enough to warrant its own category. I have several custom mechanical keyboards on
        which I have changed keycaps and firmware. My end goal is to create a split ergonomic Hall effect keyboard. For
        now, I primarily use a <a
          href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-q-he-series-keyboard/products/keychron-q3-he-qmk-wireless-custom-keyboard"
          target="_blank">Keychron Q3 HE</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="aerospace-engineering">Aerospace Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        I like planes. They defy our intuitions and soar across the sky. I like rockets. They shine as bright as the sun
        as they ascend to the cosmos.
      </p>
      <h4 id="aircraft">Aircraft</h4>
      <p>
        "War is Bad but Planes are Rad" is how I approach my interest in aircrafts. I am also interetsed in civilian
        planes, but combat aircraft specifically pique my interest. I sometimes spend my spare time building a virtual
        fighter jet in <a href="http://junoneworigins.com/" target="_blank">Juno: New Origins</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="spacecraft">Spacecraft</h4>
      <p>
        I have spent my free time designing, programming, and testing orbital launch vehicles in Juno: New Origins that
        launch autonomously and then autonomously land parts of them near the launch site for recovery to save cost.
        This experience has taught me rocketry, orbital mechanics, scripting, and control theory. You can learn more in
        <a href="projects#auto-reuse">projects</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="model-rocketry">Model Rocketry</h4>
      <p>
        I do not have the money or will to build full-size orbital rockets, so I sometimes build model rockets as a
        hobby. It is gratifying to watch something I built lift off and arc through the sky, then land safely under a
        parachute so I can repeat the process.
      </p>

      <h3 id="formula-one">Formula One</h3>
      <p>
        Formula One is one of the few sports that combines the thrill and excitement of sport with cutting-edge
        engineering. Therefore, you can sometimes find me awake at 06:00, glued to my screen, captivated by the action
        and feats of engineering roaring across the track.
      </p>

      <h3 id="graphics-design">Graphics Design</h3>
      <p>
        "Graphics design is my passion." I have dabbled in designing logos and infographics. Geometric designs and
        friendly designs with rounded rectangles or squircles are my favorite. Accessibility is a focus of mine. This
        website is an example of my graphics designs. Some sub-categories of graphics design that I am interested in are
      </p>
      <h4 id="typography">Typography</h4>
      <p>
        I love fonts, specifically sans-serif fonts, but I still cherish the occasional serif font. I especially like
        fonts that focus on legibility and accessibility. The font for this website is <a
          href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" target="_blank">JetBrains Mono</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
      <p>
        Do you know that colors are not real? They are just imaginations in our heads. It is so easy to trick our brains
        into thinking there are millions, if not billions of colors, with just three light bulbs of different colors.
        Magenta and its neighbors are the least real colors of them all. Despite this, our digital screens struggle to
        display the full gamut of colors we can "see," and we struggle to agree on a consistent way to define colors.

        this nightmare.
