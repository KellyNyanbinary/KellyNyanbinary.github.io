      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am many things: Kelly, a programmer, student, engineer, and designer. I am also KellyNyanbinary, an artist,
        disabled cyborg, IT technician, builder, and catgirl thing. I am always changing and reinventing myself. I weave
        code and art, injecting playfulness into my code and incorporating rigor into my artistic creations. I am
        passionate about learning and exploring new ideas. My interests are broad and varied, spanning computer science,
        aerospace engineering, graphics design, and whichever rabbit hole I fell into in the evening.

      <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
      <h3 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
        I solve problems with awe-inspiringly cursed code. I throw memory at problems until they go away. I force
        machines to learn the horrors of the world so humans do not have to.
      </p>

      <h3 id="computer-hardware">Computer Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning about computer hardware. I understand the performance and value of consumer parts ranging from
        CPUs and RAM to fans and PSUs. Beyond just those parts, I study laptops, mobile phones, virtual reality
        headsets, and other computer gadgets. Furthermore, I read about the inner workings of silicon chips, from
        transistors to logic blocks to core design, and the processes of their creation, from lithography to packaging.
      </p>

      <h3 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h3>
      <p>
        It can be argued that keyboards are just a subset of computer hardware, but the hobby of custom
        mechanical keyboards is large enough to warrant its own category. I have several custom mechanical keyboards on
        which I have changed keycaps and firmware. My end goal is to create a split ergonomic Hall effect keyboard. For
        now, I primarily use a <a

          target="_blank">Keychron Q3 HE</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="aerospace-engineering">Aerospace Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        I dream of soaring through the skies and exploring the stars. Even though the current state of the world and my
        disabilities prevent me from doing either, I immerse myself in readings, virtual worlds, and simulations that
        let me experience a fraction of that dream.
      </p>
      <h4 id="aircraft">Aircraft</h4>
      <p>
        I believe "war is bad but planes are rad". I am interested in civilian aviation, but combat aircraft
        specifically pique my interest. I spend some of my spare time building virtual aircraft in <a
          href="http://junoneworigins.com/" target="_blank">Juno: New Origins</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="spacecraft">Spacecraft</h4>
      <p>
        I have spent my free time designing, programming, and testing orbital launch vehicles in Juno: New Origins that
        launch and land autonomously near the launch site for recovery. This experience has taught me rocketry, orbital
        mechanics, scripting, and control theory. You can learn more in
        <a href="projects#auto-reuse">projects</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="model-rocketry">Model Rocketry</h4>
      <p>
        I do not have the money or will to build full-size orbital rockets, so I build model rockets as a hobby. It is
        gratifying to watch my creation blast off and arc through the sky, then descend safely under a parachute so I
        can do it all over again.
      </p>

      <h3 id="formula-one">Formula One</h3>
      <p>
        Formula One combines the thrill and excitement of sport with cutting-edge engineering. Therefore, you can find
        me awake at 06:00, glued to my screen, captivated by pieces of engineering art roaring across the track.
      </p>

      <h3 id="graphics-design">Graphics Design</h3>
      <p>
        "Graphics design is my passion." I have dabbled in designing logos and infographics. I focus on accessibility
        because everyone deserves to access information, regardless of their preferences or abilities. This
        website is a playground where I trial ideas and concepts.
      </p>
      <h4 id="typography">Typography</h4>
      <p>
        I am nerdy about fonts. The font for this website is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/"
          target="_blank">JetBrains Mono</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
      <p>
        Do you know that colors are not real? They are just imaginations in our heads. It is so easy to trick our brains
        into thinking there are millions, if not billions of colors, with just three light bulbs of different colors.
        Magenta and its neighbors are the least real colors of them all. Despite this, our digital screens struggle to
        display the full gamut of colors we can "see", and we struggle to agree on a consistent way to define colors.
        Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/srRI7yMjGz0" target="_blank">Juxtopposed's video</a> to learn more about
        this nightmare.
